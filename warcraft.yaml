  - title: Warcraft Propaganda Posters
    by: Laz Marquez
    description: >
      It's rare to find game inspired works from professional
      graphics designers, and these propoganda posters are fantastic. 
      According to the artist, it merges the context of Warcraft with his
      "love of the 1950's and the style of World War 2 Propaganda".

  - title: Warcraft Vintage Rail Posters
    by: Josh Atack
    description: >
      Inspired by vintage rails posters, these prints feature five
      major Azerothian cities.  Josh has "always enjoyed the aesthetics
      of vintage rail posters and the slightly over egged tourist messages."
